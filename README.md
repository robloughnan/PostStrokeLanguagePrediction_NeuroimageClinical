# Generalizing post-stroke prognoses from research data to clinical data

This respository contains the scripts for running the analysis presented in:
* Robert, Loughnan, et. al. "Generalizing post-stroke prognoses from research data to clinical data", *In Press*

This study demonstrates the importance of modelling lesion growth of stroke patients when predicting language recovery at chronic time scales from clinical scans. The order in which these scripts should be run is:

1. `Grow_Lesion_Model_Train`
2. `Study1_and_2`
3. `Study3` 

Note: dummy data is included to have the correct form for the scripts to successfully run, however they are simulated data and will not produce accurate results presented in the paper. 

To produce PCA reduced images please follow the procedure in the paper.
